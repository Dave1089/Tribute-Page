      <h2>Srinivas Ramanujan</h2>
      <em>"The man who knew infinity!"</em><br/><br/>
      <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a largely self-taught pure mathematician. Hindered by poverty and ill-health, his highly original work has considerably enriched number theory and, more recently, physics.<br/>
      In his short lifetime he produced almost 4000 proofs, identities, conjectures and equations in pure mathematics.<br/>
      His theta function lies at the heart of string theory in physics.</p>
      <p id="quote">“… each of the 24 modes in the Ramanujan function corresponds to a physical vibration of a string. Whenever the string executes its complex motions in space-time by splitting and recombining, a large number of highly sophisticated mathematical identities must be satisfied. These are precisely the mathematical identities discovered by Ramanujan.”
